### **Personal Budget Tracker (HTML Only)**  

#### **Overview**  
This is a simple **personal budget tracker** built using only HTML. It provides a structured way to manually record income and expenses without any styling or functionality beyond basic form elements.  

#### **Features**  
- A **basic table** for listing transactions.  
- **Input fields** for:  
  - Date of transaction  
  - Description (e.g., "Salary," "Rent")  
  - Amount (income/expense)  
  - Category selection (Income/Expense)  
- A **submit button** (non-functional) for future enhancements.  
- A **summary section** where users can manually update their total balance.  

#### **Usage Instructions**  
1. Enter the details of your transaction in the provided input fields.  
2. Transactions will be manually recorded in the table.  
3. Users can track and manually calculate their balance.  

#### **Limitations**  
- No automatic calculations (users must update the balance themselves).  
- No data storage (data is lost on page refresh).  
- No styling (plain HTML structure only).  

This is a **static version** and can be later enhanced with CSS for styling and JavaScript for dynamic functionality! ðŸš€
